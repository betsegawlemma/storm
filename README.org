* Introduction
This is a simple project using [[http://storm.apache.org/][Apache Storm]] which reads a 3 minute [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system][AIS data]] from file and extract some information such as vessel name, speed, direction, date,
time, maximum speed of each vessel, and the number of vessels. The project constitutes two major parts. 
 1. The first part is to parse the raw AIS data using [[https://github.com/bcl/aisparser][AISParser]]. We have used the C version of the [[file:main.c][parser]] and the resulting output file is [[file:aisfile][aisfile]].
    This aisfile has the format shown in table below. Information about the AIS data format is available at [[http://catb.org/gpsd/AIVDM.html]] 
  
| UserID | Speed Over Ground(SOG) | Course Over Ground (COG) | Vessel Name | Year | Month | Day | Hour | Minute | Second | Longitude | Latitude |
|--------+------------------------+--------------------------+-------------+------+-------+-----+------+--------+--------+-----------+----------|

 2.The second part of the project is to read the [[file:aisfile][aisfile]] one line at a time, reformat it and produced the required information.

Apache storm provides two primitives for stream transformations: Spouts and Bolts. You can check the short storm tutorial available at Apache Storm's
website [[http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Tutorial.html][here]] in order to get the basic understanding of this primitives.  
* Spout
The [[file:AISSpout.java][AISSpout.java]] program is the spout program which simply reads one line from the aisfile and emit it.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                ....
  public void nextTuple() {

     Utils.sleep(100); 
     try{
          if(fileInput.hasNextLine()){
            String[] oneLine = fileInput.nextLine().split(",");
            final ArrayList<String> ais = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(oneLine));
            _collector.emit(new Values(ais));
          }
       }catch(Exception e){
         throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage());
        }
            ....
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Bolts
All the Bolts and the main program is in the [[file:AISTopology.java][AISTopology.java]] file. It contains five bolts.
** AISSelectNamedShipsBolt 
  The purpose of this Bolt is to pass to the next bolt only streams whose name field is not empty. 
** AISFormatBolt
  This Bolt combine the Year, Month and Day fields together as a single date field and do similar formatting for the time and location fields.
** AISMesssagesPerShipBolt
  This Bolt counts the number of identification message that each vessel has send during the 3 minute period
** AISMaxSpeedPerShipBolt
  This Bolt returns the maximum speed of each vessel
** AISShipCountBolt
  This Bolt counts the number of unique vessels encountered during the 3 minute period.
** Main program
The main program creates the topology. All the bolts write their output into a file for debugging purpose. The final output looks like this.
